KomboAid Android Application
This app is intended to be an app that can be used to view character tier list, 
character match up info and create and view user notes.
The info for the lists is scraped form a website using Jsoup.
Currently it only displays the tier list of Stret Fighter V and Tekken Tag 2.
Use Android Studio to run the app on either an emulator in device.
Works on APK 14:Android 4.00 or later.
